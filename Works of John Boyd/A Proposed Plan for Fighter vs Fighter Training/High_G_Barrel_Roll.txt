a. Initiate a hard turn or break to get lateral separation, or use the diving spiral and reduce power to obtain lateral separation.
b. Reverse and barrel roll in the opposite direction without releasing your “G’s”. Come in with top rudder when coming down the opposite side of roll to prevent dish out and also to flatten out your roll.
c. Fly the aircraft on the “burble” all the way around the roll. This will slow you down, tighten your roll and tend to force your opponent to overshoot.
d. Look for your opponent high and from the direction of the roll. He will normally slide below and forward from that position if he overshoots.
**Caution**: Try to keep opponent in sight at all times as he may pull high out of the roll and wait for you to complete it before coming in again.
