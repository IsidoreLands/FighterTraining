a. Lower your nose and start a descending turn. Pull as many “G’s” as the situation warrants. This is to prevent your opponent from tracking you.
b. Avoid an excessively nose low altitude, as this will make you easier to track. However, dive steep enough to maintain the airspeed necessary to pull maximum “G’s”.
