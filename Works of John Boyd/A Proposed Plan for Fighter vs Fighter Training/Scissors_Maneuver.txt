a. Reverse and pull your nose up and into your opponent when he slides to the outside on your hard turn or break. Repeat this reversal each time your opponent slides through your flight path to the outside.
b. Use rudders to obtain maximum performance on reversing each turn of the scissors.
c. Use all power available to reduce your stall speed to its lowest.
d. Keep speed brakes in so as to gain and hold a high position. You can use them if you are sliding to your opponent’s 6 o’clock position and want to drop down without over-running.
e. Use flaps at most desirable lift position to help reduce stall speed, and elevate the nose of your aircraft.
  - This can be an insidious move if used at the proper time.
  - Be sure and know your allowable airspeed for various flap positions.
f. If your opponent ends up on top during the scissors, try to place yourself in phase with and directly underneath him before he starts sliding to your 6 o’clock position.
  - This will tend to give your opponent a visual disadvantage with the subsequent possibility of his over-controlling and stalling, or mis-maneuvering in attempting to find you.
  - A stall would tend to force him to settle and slide forward.
> **Remember** - The airspeed up to the point of stall is less than after the stall occurs (if the aircraft is not in an excessive nose high altitude), so use smooth trim and rudder technique to get the most out of the aircraft at slow airspeed.
g. If you should get your opponent in a vertical scissors by forcing him to the outside in a descending break, reduce your power, extend your brakes and drop your flaps (if slow enough) to try and force your opponent below and in front of you.
h. The decision on when to scissor an opponent will depend upon how rapidly he is sliding to the outside of the turn and how far behind he is as he slides through your flight path. Keep your opponent in sight as much as possible - a reverse too early will be to his advantage.
