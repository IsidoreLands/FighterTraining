(Assume an opponent Yo-Yo’s or slides to the outside, but not far enough forward for you to reverse into him.)
a. Wait until your opponent has about reached the apex of his Yo-Yo or has slid well to the outside.
b. Reduce some of your “G’s” and spiral down 180° away from your opponent. Relax more and more “G’s” as the distance opens up and your opponent is out of effective range (about 4000'). Only reduce enough “G’s” initially to accelerate away from your opponent and at the same time keep part of your lateral separation.
