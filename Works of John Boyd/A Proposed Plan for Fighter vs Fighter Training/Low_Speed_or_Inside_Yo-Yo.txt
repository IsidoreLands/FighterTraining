(Assume you have placed yourself at the 6 o’clock low position on your opponent and are unable to pull lead at a low airspeed.)
a. Slide to the inside by dropping your nose. Try not to burble the aircraft. This will allow you to close on him by increasing your airspeed and cutting to the inside.
b. Shallow out your turn and slide up to the 6 o’clock position when you reach about 45° - 35° from line abreast. This will position you somewhat closer to your opponent and reduce your lead requirement. You may have to repeat this a few times to position yourself correctly.
**Remember**: Your opponent can cancel you out by doing likewise or by making a hard break into you on your upswing toward his 6 o’clock position.
