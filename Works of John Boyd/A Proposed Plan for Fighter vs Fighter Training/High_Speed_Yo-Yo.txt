(Assume you are closing rapidly on an opponent)
a. Slide high and to the rear of your opponent when you are no longer able to stay in his turn radius. Trade your airspeed for altitude and therefore diminish your turn radius. Maintain your advantage by going high at 6 o’clock. Avoid waiting until the last possible moment to Yo-Yo off an opponent. He may pull or break up into you and force you on the defensive.
b. Try to slide back down to your opponent’s 6 o’clock position. Use speed brakes and power reduction as necessary to help prevent overshooting.
c. If you should slide down at too great an angle off, your opponent may pull up into you thus forcing you below and in front.
d. In this case roll one-quarter away from your opponent and pull up with him the moment he has committed himself (to keep him in sight and get on top).
e. Otherwise spiral or dive away to open up the distance as most likely the angle off will be too great and your opponent will end up on top.
