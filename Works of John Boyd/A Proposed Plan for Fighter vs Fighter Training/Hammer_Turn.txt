(Assume you are at a slow airspeed, nose high altitude with an opponent out of phase or at a distance behind - around 4000')
a. Rudder the aircraft around the top, stick to the rear. Pull your nose through the horizon toward and approximately in line with your opponent’s nose.
b. See if your opponent tries to cut you off or fly the same relative flight path you described. If he cuts you off, your chances on getting him out of phase are much better, therefore -
c. Roll into your opponent to increase his angle off and initiate a sharp pull up out of your descent to force your opponent below and possibly in front.
d. If you retard your throttle and drop a few degrees of flaps (at low A/S) you will flatten out your descent and thus greatly insure the possibility of your opponent’s overshoot.
e. When flying through all these maneuvers, use good rudder technique along with proper trim. This will insure your getting the most out of the aircraft when it is necessary. Also, learn how to use speed brakes and power reduction when most advantageous to gain your desired position.
