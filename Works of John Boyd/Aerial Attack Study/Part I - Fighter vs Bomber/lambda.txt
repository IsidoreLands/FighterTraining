Introduction
Tactics – fighter-versus-bomber, fighter-versus-fighter, or even ground
attack – are developed according to the performance capabilities or
limitations of the weapons or weapons systems used. In other words,
effective tactics reflect the best way to employ a given weapon against
a given enemy with known or estimated capabilities. Assuming this to
be true, tactics are functional – that is, they reflect the capabilities and
limitations of the opponent’s weapons as well as our own. Therefore, in
our discussion of aerial attack, we must determine the operation envelopes
of our weapons systems (this includes the aircraft and its associated
armament). After having learned these envelope parameters, the discussion
will center on how to best employer weapons systems in a given fighterversus-fighter or fighter-versus-bomber situation, in which we assume that
our opponent has comparable capabilities.
Fighter-versus-bomber tactics will be covered first. In this phase, we
assume that a maneuvering fighter attacks a non-maneuvering target;
whereas in the fighter-versus-fighter phase, we assume that a maneuvering
fighter attacks a maneuvering target. Since the fighter-versus-bomber
situation has only one variable – the maneuvering fighter – a more exact
technical analysis can be accomplished on it. In addition, fighter-versusbomber theory is a fundamental departure point for fighter-versus-fighter
combat.

BASIC LIMITATIONS OF THE DISTURBED SIGHT AND THE 20MM
CANNON
To adequately employ the disturbed sight and the 20mm cannon, we
must understand the limitations of this equipment in any tactical situation.
The operating range of the ASG-17 disturbed sight is from 600
to 6000 feet. It will compute the proper prediction angle for a target
throughout that range, from the ground up to 50,000 feet and from zero to
nine G, if the pilot can track the target properly. However, it is improbable
that a pilot would be able to deliver a lethal burst of fire at a range greater
than 3,000 feet because of the difficulty in tracking beyond that range.
To accurately predict the lead requirement, any disturbed sight
requires the following basic information: range and target angular velocity.
In the disturbed sight, range is provided by the ranging radar, and target
angular velocity information is acquired by tracking the target aircraft.
Since the pilot is forced to turn his aircraft at a certain rate, this rate of
turn is a representation of target motion and is directly proportional to
target speed. The angular velocity of the attacking aircraft is set into the
sight through gyro action. The information is then married to the input
from the radar and the proper prediction angle is computed by placing
an electrical restraint (stiffness current) on the gyros. At long ranges,
little restraint is applied, while at short ranges a great amount of restraint
is applied. At ranges beyond 3,000 feet, little restraint is applied, thus
producing a tracking index which is quite loose and difficult to control.
Since the pilot’s responses are not precise enough, results are usually poor,
even though the equipment may be working properly.
Another limitation is the cone of dispersion of the 20mm cannon.
For the M-39, harmonization criteria specifies that 80% of all rounds fired
must impact in a 4-mil cone. As we increase firing range, bullet density will
be decreased by a function of the square (if range doubles, bullet density
quarters). At 3,000 feet, bullet density will be decreased to 1 ∕ 9 that at 1,000
feet. As a result, an attacker must fire over a longer time span in order to
deliver a lethal burst. At the same time, he must track a target smaller in
perspective. Since it is extremely difficult to track with the disturbed sight
at ranges greater than 3,000 feet, and the 20mm cone of dispersion causes
loss of effective bullet density at this range, we consider our maximum
range for the disturbed sight/20mm cannon as 3,000 feet.
BASIC LIMITATIONS OF THE AIM-9B (GAR-8) MISSILE AGAINST A
NON-MANEUVERING TARGET
AIM-9B is a supersonic infra-red-homing missile, launched in the
target’s tail cone on a pursuit course, using the fixed sight. After launch, the
missile maneuvers to establish a collision course with

1

the target. In other words, the missile determines where the target is going
and heads for that point in space. To successfully employ Sidewinder in a
given tactical situation, you must be within its firing envelope. This firing
envelope is determined by: (1) The radiation pattern of the target and
(2) The performance envelope of the missile. The radiation pattern of a
particular target is the area in which you can detect its IR radiation. The
performance envelope is determined by: Range of the missile, number of
G which the missile can pull and lambda (look -angle) limitations. Thus,
the basic limitations of the missile, against a non-maneuvering target are
determined by: Infra-red pattern, range, G and lambda. Since tactics are
developed according to the performance capabilities or limitations of the
weapons used, discussion of the limitations is in order.
IR Pattern
The missile gyro-seeker locks onto the strongest point-source of
IR radiation. For a target in military power, the strongest point-source
is the hot metal of the jet’s tailpipe. Approximately 85% of the IR signal
generated comes from this hot metal and the remaining 15% comes from
the hot jet exhaust. For a target operating in afterburner, the primary
source of radiation is the hot exhaust flame. Approximately 60% of the
signal generated comes from flame and 40% is generated by the hot metal
of the tailpipe. In the discussion of radiation patterns, it is necessary to
keep in mind the shape of the pattern. In aircraft with shielded tailpipes,
radiation patterns are generally long and relatively narrow; whereas, in
aircraft which do not have shielded tailpipes, the patterns are long and
wide. In fighter -type aircraft, the radiation pattern is generally long and
relatively narrow since the geometry of the aircraft shields the tailpipe. This
applies in military power only. In afterburner power, naturally, the pattern
is long and wide, since the flame of the afterburner is not shielded by the
jet’s aft fuselage. In both English and Soviet bomber-type airplanes, in the
horizontal plane, the jet tailpipe is shielded by the sweep-back of the wings,
thus presenting a long narrow pattern. In the vertical plane, however, the
pattern is long and wide, since the wings do not shield the hot metal and
the jet exhaust. USAF bomber-type aircraft, on the other hand, present
long and wide horizontal patterns, since the engine nacelles are suspended
below the wing, providing the gyro-seeker a relatively unrestricted view
of the jet exhaust. In the overhead vertical plane, the pattern is long and
narrow, since the wing shields the IR radiation from the gyro-seeker.
Radiation patterns vary with tailpipe temperature as well as with area of
the source. In other words, the greater the temperature, the greater the
radiation pattern; and, logically, the larger the source, the greater the
radiation pattern. To illustrate: A bomber with 8 engines in military power,
as compared to a fighter with one engine in military power, would generate
a much larger radiation pattern because the area of the source is much
greater.

Background IR sources are significant factors affecting the size and
shape of radiation patterns. Important background IR sources are (1) Sun,
(2) Clouds, (3) Water, (4) Snow and (5) Terrain.
(1) Sun: The sun is the strongest source of infra-red energy known.
You cannot fire Sidewinder at targets flying directly between you and the
sun, since the sun’s radiation will decoy the missile away from the target.
Therefore, do not fire at a target which is within 25° of the sun. Also, do
not continuously point the missile directly at the sun for more than ten
seconds, or the lead sulphide detector may be permanently damaged.
(2) Clouds: Clouds reflect IR radiation from the sun – particularly
cumulus clouds. If you must fire at a target which is framed against a bright
cloud background, in all probability you will be forced to reduce your slant
range to 6,000 or 8,000 feet (AFMDC ADJ SS-845) to obtain proper signal
discrimination. If the target is hidden by clouds, the clouds will confuse the
target signal so that the missile will not home. The signal which you receive
will be the background radiation reflected by the clouds. A good ruleof-thumb for flying in clouds or against a cloud background is: diminish
range until it is possible to discriminate between the background and the
target signal.
(3) Water: Water, like clouds, reflects IR energy from the sun. Calm
water is a tremendous background radiator when the sun’s images can
actually be seen in the water. Rough or choppy water, on the other hand,
reflects IR radiation in all directions and the attacker need not be in a
position where he can see the image of the sun on the water. As when
operating against a cloud background, diminish range until you can
achieve proper signal discrimination.
(4) Snow: Snow, like water and clouds, reflects the sun’s IR energy.
When firing against a snow background, as compared to a water or cloud
background, you will have to diminish your slant range much more in
order to get proper signal discrimination. There is a good possibility that
you will be forced inside the missile’s minimum range, thereby precluding
a missile attack.
(5) Terrain: Terrain background reduces maximum missile range,
as do clouds and other previously mentioned backgrounds. Light
terrain in particular, such as dry lakes and sand, provides maximum
background radiation. When firing against the three previously mentioned
backgrounds, under an overcast, max range is not diminished nearly as
much as when firing under CAVU conditions, since the clouds act as a
device for shielding out the sun’s IR radiation.

Range:
AIM-9B has both minimum and maximum range restrictions. Basic
minimum range for launching is 3,000 feet. This is determined by three
factors: (1) Time for the influence fuze to arm, (2) Time for the missile to
set up a collision course, and (3) Delta Mach. To be assured of a kill, all
three of these factors must be considered. First, time for the influence fuze
to arm: It has been proven through empirical testing, that approximately
85% of the kills achieved have been through influence fuze action. Since
it takes the influence fuze about two seconds to arm – at rocket motor
burn-out – a minimum range must be considered. Second, time for the
missile to set up a collision course: After launching, the missile does not
begin to guide until it clears the launch aircraft. This delay lasts for about
1 ∕ 2 second, at the end of which time the missile receives its first guidance
command and starts to set up a collision course. Third, Delta Mach (rate
of closure): At rocket motor burn-out, the missile is traveling about 1.7
Mach above the speed of the launch aircraft. If the launch aircraft has a
high rate of closure, the missile has a faster airspeed relative to the target.
Since it takes a definite time for the influence fuze to arm, and a definite
time for the missile to set up a collision course, the missile must travel a
greater distance, relative to the target, before either one of these occurs.
Missile firing range can be determined by use of the following formula:
Minimum range is equal to 3000 ± (Delta Mach × 3000). To illustrate :
If the launch aircraft is traveling at 1.2 Mach and the target aircraft at .8
Mach, we have a Delta Mach of .4. Applying this to the formula, we see that
minimum range is equal to 3000 + (.4 × 3000), or 4200 feet. The general
“rule-of-thumb” for minimum range, co-airspeed, co-altitude, however,
is 3000 feet. Maximum Range: Maximum range is determined by three
factors – guidance time, air density, and Delta Mach. Missile guidance time
is approximately 18 seconds, which is a constant value applied to both air
density and Delta Mach. Air density is important factor, in that the higher
the air density the greater the aerodynamic drag, thus the shorter the range
over an 18-second time period. Delta Mach is important in that the faster
the launch aircraft, the faster the missile in relation to the target; thus, over
an 18-second time period, the greater the distance the missile will travel.
Many max-range charts have been developed by both the Air Force and
the Navy to depict the maximum range at various altitudes, airspeeds, and
Delta Mach relationships; however, it is virtually impossible to remember
all these relationships.
The following “rules-of-thumb” may be used by the pilot to determine
max range:
(1) For co-speed attacks against trans-sonic bombers – one mile for
altitudes below 10,000 feet, add one-half mile range for each additional
10,000 feet increase in altitude.

4

(2) For co-speed attacks against supersonic targets – one mile range
for altitudes below 20,000 feet and add one-half mile for each additional
10,000-foot increase in altitude. In applying the rules-of-thumb we can
see that Sidewinder’s max-effective range against a sub-sonic target at
30,000 feet would be two miles, or, roughly 10,000 feet slant range. Against
a supersonic target at 30,000 feet, the maximum slant range would be
approximately one and one-half mile, or, roughly 7800 feet.
(3) Delta Mach “rule-of-thumb”: Add one thousand feet for each .1
Delta Mach when above 30,000 feet altitude. To illustrate: A .8 Mach target,
at 30,000 feet, is being attacked by a 1.2-Mach fighter at the same altitude.
Applying the sub-sonic rule-of-thumb, we find that the max-effective range
at which we can launch the missile is 10,000 feet, or approximately 2 miles,
for a co-speed condition. Adding 4000 feet for .4 Delta Mach, we compute
a new max-effective range of 14,000 feet.
The only problem now is range estimation. When in the cockpit of
an attacking fighter, at minimum ranges, there is no problem, since we
may use the ASG-17 radar to determine range. At max range, however,
we are beyond the capability of the radar and must use another means
of determining our approximate range from a given target. For normal
missile firing ranges, fairly accurate range estimation can be accomplished
by comparing a known aircraft wingspan with the sight reticle radius, or
with pipper diameter. Applying the formula,
X=

WS × 1000
S

Where
X = size of the target in mils
WS= wingspan of the target in feet
S = range of the attacking fighter from the target
we can determine the size of the target, in relation to the 70-mil-diameter
reticle or 2-mil pipper.
Example 1:
Size of Badger (wingspan 116’) in mils when range is 10,000’
X=

116 × 1000
= 11.6 or approximately 12 mils
10,000

This means that at 10,000 feet, the Badger wingspan will subtend 1 ∕ 3 of
reticle radius (35 mils). At 20,000 feet the Badger span will be 6 mils and
will subtend 3 pipper widths. At 5,000 feet the Badger span will be 23 mils
and will subtend 2 ∕ 3 of a reticle radius.

5

Example 2
Size of F-100 (wingspan 39’) in mils when range is 10,000 feet
39 × 1000
= 3.9 or approximately 4 mils
10,000
At 10,000 feet the F-100 wingspan will subtend 2 pipper widths. At 20,000
feet it will subtend 1 pipper width, and at 5000 feet, 4 pipper widths or
approximately 1 ∕ 5 of radius.
X=

G
AIM-9B can pull approximately 10G at sea level and approximately
3.5 G at 50,000 feet. The 10G maximum at sea level extends almost
all the way to 30,000 feet. From that altitude upward, the capability
decreases until, at 50,000 feet the missile can pull approximately 3.5 G. In
other words, Sidewinder can pull 10G from sea level to 30,000 feet and
approximately 3.5 G at 50,000 feet. Maximum fighter G, when launching,
is approximately 2G below 40,000 feet and 1.6 G above 40,000 feet. The
G-capability of the missile determines the G-limit on the fighter at launch.
To illustrate: The rate of turn of the fighter in a pursuit curve is dependent
on target speed, angle off, and range, as indicated by the following formula:
Vt × Sin θ
W=
Range
Where
W = Rate of turn in radians per second
Vt = Target velocity in feet per second
Sinθ = Sine of the angle-off
By examining the formula we can see that the rate of turn (W) increases
any time target velocity or angle-off increases, and decreases as range
increases. The number of G which the fighter pulls, at a given rate of turn,
is directly proportional to fighter speed, and may be represented by the
following formula:
W=

32.2 × N
Vf

Where
N = Number of radial G
Vf = Fighter velocity in feet per second
W = Rate of turn in radians per second
We can see from the formula that any time fighter velocity increases, we
must also increase G (N), in an effort to maintain a given turn rate.
Rate of turn required for the missile to set up a collision course is
dependent upon five factors: (1) target speed, (2) angle-off,
6

(3) range, (4) enabling time, and, (5) the navigational constant. The
number of G which the missile pulls, for a given rate of turn, is directly
proportional to missile speed. The higher the speed, the higher the G.
If the missile is launched from a Mach 1 fighter pulling 2G, how many
G must the missile pull in order to maintain the same rate of turn as the
launching fighter? As shown by the formula
Vf × W
32.2
since the missile (V) is going 1.7 Mach above the launch aircraft’s velocity,
or 2.7 Mach, it must pull 5.4 G, in order to maintain the same rate of turn
as the launching fighter. Why, then, are we committed to pull a maximum
of 2G when the missile can pull 10G, an amount considerably greater than
the 5.4 G which we just computed? AIM-9B does not begin to guide until
1 ∕ 2 second after launch, at which time it receives its first guidance signal
to set up a collision course. During this enabling period (1 ∕ 2 second) the
missile has the characteristics of an ordinary rocket. Because of this, an
additional rate of turn is necessary to set up its collision course. To set up
the collision course, Sidewinder turns 3 1 ∕ 2 times the rate of turn of the
gyro-seeker – this is a navigational constant. Because of this, the rate of
turn generated by the missile, in the first maneuver, is greater than the
rate of turn of the launching fighter. Since the number of G pulled by the
missile and fighter is equated to rate of turn and velocity, it is obvious that
the 2G limitation of the fighter at launch is tied to the 10G limitation of the
missile. If more than 2G is pulled, the tracking rate of the gyro-seeker is
exceeded by the line-of-sight rate, thus the seeker loses the target.
N=

Another means of exceeding the tracking rate of the gyro-seeker is
to launch the missile with an angle-of-attack in excess of 12° (the angle
between the missile’s longitudinal axis and the launch aircraft’s flight
path). For the F-100, since the missile launcher line is aligned 2° below
the fuselage reference line, the maximum aircraft angle of attack is 14°. If
launched with a greater angle of attack, Sidewinder will jump toward flight
path, causing the tracking rate of the gyro-seeker to be exceeded by the
line-of-sight rate, consequently the gyro-seeker will lose the target. When
this happens, the missile goes ballistic. To avoid exceeding a 14° angle
of attack, the F-100 should not be flown at less than 170 knots in a 1G
condition and 230 knots in a 2G condition.
Lambda
Lambda limit is simply the max look-angle between the axis of the
gyro-seeker and the longitudinal axis of the missile – a 25-degree cone
with its center along the longitudinal axis of the missile. Why are we
interested in this lambda limitation? It is possible for a pilot to satisfy the
conditions of IR, range, and G, yet be outside the lambda capability of the
missile. Lambda limit may be exceeded by a combination of two factors:
low missile velocity and high angle-off.
7

(1) Low Missile Velocity: One-half second after launch, Sidewinder
turns to establish a collision course with the target. Two seconds after
launch, it has a velocity 1.7 Mach greater than that of the launch aircraft.
To establish a collision course, Sidewinder turns 3 1 ∕ 2 times the rate of
the gyro-seeker axis to reduce the line of sight rate to zero, or establish
a constant angular relationship between the missile and the target. After
rocket motor burn-out, the missile begins to slow down. In order to
maintain a collision course after deceleration, the gyro-seeker must look
farther and farther to the side as it nears the target. In other words, as
illustrated by figures 1 and 2, as the missile slows down, the lambda angle
increases until collision occurs.

SLOW MISSILE

(2) High Angle-Off, the other basic cause of lambda-limiting is
understood by considering a missile which, immediately upon launching,
could turn onto the collision course. The line-of-sight angle would remain
constant and the gyro-seeker would thus remain with its axis along the
initial pursuit heading. It can be seen in figures 3 and 4 that the collision
course for launching well off the tail differs in direction from the initial
heading much more than does the collision course for launching slightly
off the tail.

LARGE INITIAL ANGLE OFF
Figure 3

SMALL INITIAL ANGLE OFF
Figure 4

Consequently, the higher the angle-off, the greater the lambda angle. At
long range (within max missile range) lambda limitation occurs at smaller
angles-off, because of the effect of lambda-limitation on decreasing missile
velocity. At short range, lambda limitation is caused by the sharp turn
which the missile must perform. You will recall that if an attacker fires
with any appreciable angle-off at short range, he will be very near his 2G
limitation, or near the 10G limitation of the missile itself. This means that
the missile is turning sharply to set up its collision course. The sharper the
turn, the higher the missile angle of attack. As shown in figure 5, the angle
of attack adds to the lambda angle so that lambda limit is reached. When
lambda limit is exceeded, the gyro-seeker bumps against a mechanical stop,
slows the gyro to a halt and the missile goes ballistic. Since we have no
instrumentation available to measure lambda limit, we provide an artificial
means to represent this lambda limitation – do not fire at angles-off greater
than 30°. At 40,000 feet and above,

SHORT RANGE LAMBDA LIMITATION
Figure 5

10

do not exceed 10° angle-off – this is primarily because of servo-bias (poor
burning of powder). This will preclude the possibility of an attacking pilot
exceeding the lambda limitation of his missile.
In order to kill with Sidewinder, you must be within the firing
envelope as defined by the infrared, range, G and lambda limitations. If a
pilot exceeds any one of these limits, kill-probability drops drastically. For
practical purposes, we can define the missile firing envelope as a 60° cone
emanating from the tail of the target aircraft, with its length dependent
upon altitude and rate of closure (Delta Mach). For future use, we will
describe this cone as an angular velocity cone or a cone of maximum
performance.
