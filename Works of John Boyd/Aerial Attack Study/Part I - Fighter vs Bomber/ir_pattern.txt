Introduction
Tactics – fighter-versus-bomber, fighter-versus-fighter, or even ground
attack – are developed according to the performance capabilities or
limitations of the weapons or weapons systems used. In other words,
effective tactics reflect the best way to employ a given weapon against
a given enemy with known or estimated capabilities. Assuming this to
be true, tactics are functional – that is, they reflect the capabilities and
limitations of the opponent’s weapons as well as our own. Therefore, in
our discussion of aerial attack, we must determine the operation envelopes
of our weapons systems (this includes the aircraft and its associated
armament). After having learned these envelope parameters, the discussion
will center on how to best employer weapons systems in a given fighterversus-fighter or fighter-versus-bomber situation, in which we assume that
our opponent has comparable capabilities.
Fighter-versus-bomber tactics will be covered first. In this phase, we
assume that a maneuvering fighter attacks a non-maneuvering target;
whereas in the fighter-versus-fighter phase, we assume that a maneuvering
fighter attacks a maneuvering target. Since the fighter-versus-bomber
situation has only one variable – the maneuvering fighter – a more exact
technical analysis can be accomplished on it. In addition, fighter-versusbomber theory is a fundamental departure point for fighter-versus-fighter
combat.

BASIC LIMITATIONS OF THE DISTURBED SIGHT AND THE 20MM
CANNON
To adequately employ the disturbed sight and the 20mm cannon, we
must understand the limitations of this equipment in any tactical situation.
The operating range of the ASG-17 disturbed sight is from 600
to 6000 feet. It will compute the proper prediction angle for a target
throughout that range, from the ground up to 50,000 feet and from zero to
nine G, if the pilot can track the target properly. However, it is improbable
that a pilot would be able to deliver a lethal burst of fire at a range greater
than 3,000 feet because of the difficulty in tracking beyond that range.
To accurately predict the lead requirement, any disturbed sight
requires the following basic information: range and target angular velocity.
In the disturbed sight, range is provided by the ranging radar, and target
angular velocity information is acquired by tracking the target aircraft.
Since the pilot is forced to turn his aircraft at a certain rate, this rate of
turn is a representation of target motion and is directly proportional to
target speed. The angular velocity of the attacking aircraft is set into the
sight through gyro action. The information is then married to the input
from the radar and the proper prediction angle is computed by placing
an electrical restraint (stiffness current) on the gyros. At long ranges,
little restraint is applied, while at short ranges a great amount of restraint
is applied. At ranges beyond 3,000 feet, little restraint is applied, thus
producing a tracking index which is quite loose and difficult to control.
Since the pilot’s responses are not precise enough, results are usually poor,
even though the equipment may be working properly.
Another limitation is the cone of dispersion of the 20mm cannon.
For the M-39, harmonization criteria specifies that 80% of all rounds fired
must impact in a 4-mil cone. As we increase firing range, bullet density will
be decreased by a function of the square (if range doubles, bullet density
quarters). At 3,000 feet, bullet density will be decreased to 1 ∕ 9 that at 1,000
feet. As a result, an attacker must fire over a longer time span in order to
deliver a lethal burst. At the same time, he must track a target smaller in
perspective. Since it is extremely difficult to track with the disturbed sight
at ranges greater than 3,000 feet, and the 20mm cone of dispersion causes
loss of effective bullet density at this range, we consider our maximum
range for the disturbed sight/20mm cannon as 3,000 feet.
BASIC LIMITATIONS OF THE AIM-9B (GAR-8) MISSILE AGAINST A
NON-MANEUVERING TARGET
AIM-9B is a supersonic infra-red-homing missile, launched in the
target’s tail cone on a pursuit course, using the fixed sight. After launch, the
missile maneuvers to establish a collision course with

1

the target. In other words, the missile determines where the target is going
and heads for that point in space. To successfully employ Sidewinder in a
given tactical situation, you must be within its firing envelope. This firing
envelope is determined by: (1) The radiation pattern of the target and
(2) The performance envelope of the missile. The radiation pattern of a
particular target is the area in which you can detect its IR radiation. The
performance envelope is determined by: Range of the missile, number of
G which the missile can pull and lambda (look -angle) limitations. Thus,
the basic limitations of the missile, against a non-maneuvering target are
determined by: Infra-red pattern, range, G and lambda. Since tactics are
developed according to the performance capabilities or limitations of the
weapons used, discussion of the limitations is in order.
IR Pattern
The missile gyro-seeker locks onto the strongest point-source of
IR radiation. For a target in military power, the strongest point-source
is the hot metal of the jet’s tailpipe. Approximately 85% of the IR signal
generated comes from this hot metal and the remaining 15% comes from
the hot jet exhaust. For a target operating in afterburner, the primary
source of radiation is the hot exhaust flame. Approximately 60% of the
signal generated comes from flame and 40% is generated by the hot metal
of the tailpipe. In the discussion of radiation patterns, it is necessary to
keep in mind the shape of the pattern. In aircraft with shielded tailpipes,
radiation patterns are generally long and relatively narrow; whereas, in
aircraft which do not have shielded tailpipes, the patterns are long and
wide. In fighter -type aircraft, the radiation pattern is generally long and
relatively narrow since the geometry of the aircraft shields the tailpipe. This
applies in military power only. In afterburner power, naturally, the pattern
is long and wide, since the flame of the afterburner is not shielded by the
jet’s aft fuselage. In both English and Soviet bomber-type airplanes, in the
horizontal plane, the jet tailpipe is shielded by the sweep-back of the wings,
thus presenting a long narrow pattern. In the vertical plane, however, the
pattern is long and wide, since the wings do not shield the hot metal and
the jet exhaust. USAF bomber-type aircraft, on the other hand, present
long and wide horizontal patterns, since the engine nacelles are suspended
below the wing, providing the gyro-seeker a relatively unrestricted view
of the jet exhaust. In the overhead vertical plane, the pattern is long and
narrow, since the wing shields the IR radiation from the gyro-seeker.
Radiation patterns vary with tailpipe temperature as well as with area of
the source. In other words, the greater the temperature, the greater the
radiation pattern; and, logically, the larger the source, the greater the
radiation pattern. To illustrate: A bomber with 8 engines in military power,
as compared to a fighter with one engine in military power, would generate
a much larger radiation pattern because the area of the source is much
greater.

Background IR sources are significant factors affecting the size and
shape of radiation patterns. Important background IR sources are (1) Sun,
(2) Clouds, (3) Water, (4) Snow and (5) Terrain.
(1) Sun: The sun is the strongest source of infra-red energy known.
You cannot fire Sidewinder at targets flying directly between you and the
sun, since the sun’s radiation will decoy the missile away from the target.
Therefore, do not fire at a target which is within 25° of the sun. Also, do
not continuously point the missile directly at the sun for more than ten
seconds, or the lead sulphide detector may be permanently damaged.
(2) Clouds: Clouds reflect IR radiation from the sun – particularly
cumulus clouds. If you must fire at a target which is framed against a bright
cloud background, in all probability you will be forced to reduce your slant
range to 6,000 or 8,000 feet (AFMDC ADJ SS-845) to obtain proper signal
discrimination. If the target is hidden by clouds, the clouds will confuse the
target signal so that the missile will not home. The signal which you receive
will be the background radiation reflected by the clouds. A good ruleof-thumb for flying in clouds or against a cloud background is: diminish
range until it is possible to discriminate between the background and the
target signal.
(3) Water: Water, like clouds, reflects IR energy from the sun. Calm
water is a tremendous background radiator when the sun’s images can
actually be seen in the water. Rough or choppy water, on the other hand,
reflects IR radiation in all directions and the attacker need not be in a
position where he can see the image of the sun on the water. As when
operating against a cloud background, diminish range until you can
achieve proper signal discrimination.
(4) Snow: Snow, like water and clouds, reflects the sun’s IR energy.
When firing against a snow background, as compared to a water or cloud
background, you will have to diminish your slant range much more in
order to get proper signal discrimination. There is a good possibility that
you will be forced inside the missile’s minimum range, thereby precluding
a missile attack.
(5) Terrain: Terrain background reduces maximum missile range,
as do clouds and other previously mentioned backgrounds. Light
terrain in particular, such as dry lakes and sand, provides maximum
background radiation. When firing against the three previously mentioned
backgrounds, under an overcast, max range is not diminished nearly as
much as when firing under CAVU conditions, since the clouds act as a
device for shielding out the sun’s IR radiation.
