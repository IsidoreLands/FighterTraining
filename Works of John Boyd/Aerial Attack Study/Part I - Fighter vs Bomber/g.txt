ghter
pilot who focused on developing tactics
related to air combat maneuvering, was
the primary author of the Aerial Attack
Study. During the development of the
Aerial Attack Study, he was the Academic
Supervisor at the Fighter Weapons School
at Nellis Air Force Base.
During late-1959 and early-1960, Boyd
did much of the development during his
off-duty hours. Boyd was not designated
to develop a tactics manual. There was not
a formal project budget. The Aerial Attack
Study was produced using a typewriter,
stencils, and a mimeograph process.
Examples in the Aerial Attack Study
include references to the North American
F-100 Super Sabre. This single-seat,
single-engine jet aircraft was the first
United States Air Force fighter capable of
exceeding Mach 1 in level flight.
The United States Air Force designated the original 1960 release of the Aerial Attack Study as
secret. Other individuals made revisions in 1963 and 1964. After several more years, the Air
Force de-classified the Aerial Attack Study.
