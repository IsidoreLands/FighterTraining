INTRODUCTION
In our discussion of fighter-versus-bomber tactics, you will recall, we
determined the capabilities and limitations of our weapons systems. On
having learned these parameters, we then developed our fighter-versusbomber tactical doctrine. In our discussion of fighter-versus-fighter tactics,
we will employ this same procedure. The order of discussion will be as
follows:
1. Basic limitations of AIM-9B Against a Maneuvering Target
2. Fighter Maneuvers
3. Tactical Formation
4. Flight Tactics
When analyzing fighter-versus-fighter tactics, by way of the four major
phases above, we will employ the case system â€“ a plan whereby we examine
possible hypothetical situations which the pilot may encounter in fighterversus-fighter combat.
