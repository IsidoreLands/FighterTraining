**SAGA PROPOSAL**

**Submitted By:** [Your Name/Handle]
**Date:** [Current Date]

### 1. OBSERVATION (The Echo)

**Path Chosen:** [A - Engineer / B - Designer / C - Doctrine Analyst]

**Describe the specific Echo you observed:**
*(e.g., "The tests for `design_service.py` failed on initial run due to a missing dependency in the setup instructions.")*
*(e.g., "The slider for adjusting wing sweep has no numerical input field, making precise adjustments impossible.")*
*(e.g., "The definition of 'Drag' in the E-M doctrine memorandum is ambiguous about cognitive overhead vs. dependency burden.")*

---

### 2. ORIENTATION (Heroes & Nemeses)

**The Hero (What works well?):**
*(e.g., "The use of Docker in the API setup makes the initial environment very consistent.")*
*(e.g., "The 3D viewer in the UI prototype provides instant, clear feedback.")*

**The Nemesis (What is the point of friction?):**
*(e.g., "The `README.md` is out of date, creating a barrier to entry for new contributors. This is a Vice of 'informational decay'.")*
*(e.g., "The lack of precision input creates user frustration and slows the design OODA loop. This is a Vice of 'interface inefficiency'.")*

---

### 3. DECISION (The Proposed Saga)

**Saga Title:**
*(e.g., "Saga: Update and Clarify `genesis-api` README for New Contributors")*

**Saga Description (What action should be taken?):**
*(e.g., "The `README.md` in the `/genesis-api` repository should be updated to include the missing `pip install -r requirements-dev.txt` step. The expected Python version should also be specified.")*

**Expected E-M Impact (A forecast):**
*   **Ps (Thrust):** [e.g., Neutral. This does not change core functionality.]
*   **Maneuverability:** [e.g., Positive. A clearer setup process makes it easier for new developers to contribute, increasing organizational agility.]
*   **Drag:** [e.g., Negative. It reduces the time-to-first-commit for new members, lowering a key source of project friction.]
