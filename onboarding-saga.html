        <h1>Saga #GEN-001: Orient Yourself</h1>

        <p>You have chosen to do something. Welcome. Your first task is not to write code or design a wing. It is to complete an OODA Loop. Your objective is to understand the system and identify a single point of friction—a Nemesis—and propose a solution—a new Saga.</p>

        <div class="task-block">
            <h2>Phase 1: OBSERVE</h2>
            <p>Your task is to find an **Echo**—an undeniable piece of feedback about the current state of the GENESIS project. This Echo can come from any domain.</p>
            <p>Choose <strong>one</strong> of the following observation paths:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Path A (The Engineer):</strong> Clone the <a href="https://github.com/[YOUR_ORG]/genesis-api" target="_blank">genesis-api</a> repository. Follow the `README.md` to set it up and run the tests. The test output is your Echo.</li>
                <li><strong>Path B (The Designer):</strong> Review the current user interface design for the vehicle editor. Use this prototype link: <a href="[LINK_TO_FIGMA_PROTOTYPE]" target="_blank">[Figma Prototype]</a>. Your user experience is your Echo.</li>
                <li><strong>Path C (The Doctrine Analyst):</strong> Read the project's Architectural Doctrine: <a href="[LINK_TO_DOCTRINE_MEMO]" target="_blank">[Doctrine v2.0]</a>. The clarity or ambiguity of the document is your Echo.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="task-block">
            <h2>Phase 2: ORIENT</h2>
            <p>Filter your Echo through the project's objectives. Identify a **Hero** (something that works well) and a **Nemesis** (a point of friction, confusion, or inefficiency). Your analysis is the synthesis of these observations.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="task-block">
            <h2>Phase 3: DECIDE</h2>
            <p>Based on your orientation, form a decision. Your decision must be to propose a new **Saga** that either amplifies a Virtue (a pattern that creates Heroes) or destroys a Vice (a pattern that creates Nemeses).</p>
        </div>

        <div class="task-block">
            <h2>Phase 4: ACT</h2>
            <p>Your final action is to formalize your new Saga. Go to the main project repository's <a href="https://github.com/[YOUR_ORG]/.github/blob/main/SAGA_PROPOSAL.md" target="_blank">Saga Proposal Template</a>. Copy the template, fill it out with your analysis from the Orient and Decide phases, and submit it by emailing it to <a href="mailto:architect@genesis-project.dev">architect@genesis-project.dev</a> with the subject "Saga Proposal".</p>
            <p>This action closes your first loop and begins the next. We will review your proposal and assign you your next Saga. Your work has begun.</p>
