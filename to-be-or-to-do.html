        <h1>A Roll Call</h1>
        
        <p>In life, there comes a fork in the road. A decision must be made about which direction to go.</p>
        
        <blockquote>
            “If you go that way you can be somebody. You will have to make compromises and you will have to turn your back on your friends. But you will be a member of the club and you will get promoted and you will get good assignments.”
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote>
            “Or you can go that way and you can do something — something for your country and for your Air Force and for yourself. If you decide you want to do something, you may not get promoted and you may not get the good assignments and you certainly will not be a favorite of your superiors. But you won’t have to compromise yourself. You will be true to your friends and to yourself. And your work might make a difference.”
        </blockquote>

        <p>This project is a place for those who choose the second path. We are not building a static product; we are building an adaptive system for generating and testing ideas. Our goal is not status, but impact. Our method is not conformity, but a relentless cycle of destruction and creation.</p>
        
        <p>Your background does not matter. Your title does not matter. Your willingness to engage with the reality of the problem is all that matters.</p>

        <div class="decision-point">
            <p>A roll call is being taken. You must make a decision.</p>
